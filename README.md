> [!NOTE]
> **A More Friendly, User-Friendly, and Intelligent Obsidian AI Assistant**  

![SC1_Title.gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a50a1f80-39ff-4eba-8090-e3d75e7be98c)

**Next Composer is a fork of Smart Composer.** Built upon Smart Composer's foundation, I've added the following new features to provide you with a more intelligent and convenient AI writing experience.

## New Features

*   **Custom Assistants (Agents)**: You can freely set different assistants' system prompts and save them to adapt to different writing scenarios.
*   **Optimized Provider and Model Settings**: We've restructured the provider and model settings interface to be more centralized and easier to manage, solving the overly complex and scattered issues in the original version.
*   **More Powerful RAG Features**: Now you can more conveniently select specific folders to include or exclude for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and the embedding database supports automatic updates over time.
*   **Brand New AI Continuation and Rewriting**: Through keyword triggers combined with custom prompts in floating windows, providing you with a smooth and efficient AI continuation and rewriting experience.

## Future Plans

*   **Learning Mode and Flashcard Creation**: Integrating learning features to help users memorize and review more efficiently.
*   **Fully Automatic YOLO Mode**: An intelligent mode that supports automatic background operation, keeping AI ready whenever you need it.
